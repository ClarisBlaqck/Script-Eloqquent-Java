    <p>This is the beginning of JavaScript. It's all about practice</p>
    <h2>Exercises From Eloquent JavaScript (Third Edition) by Marijn Haverbeke</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 2 Eloquent JavaScript</h3>
    <h4>Excercise 1</h4>
    <p>Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following
        triangle:</p>
    <h4>Excercise 2</h4>
    <p>Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1
            to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
            instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print
            "Buzz" instead.
            When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz
            " for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz"
            or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).</p>
    <h4>Excercise 3</h4>
    <p>newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there
        is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a
        chessboard.
        
        When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding
        size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size,
        outputting a grid of the given width and height.</p>
